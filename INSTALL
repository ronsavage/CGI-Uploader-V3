Introduction
------------
This is the INSTALL file for CGI::Uploader 2.90_xx, the intermediate version of CGI::Uploader V 3.

Installation
------------
1)
This distro can be installed just like any other, but don't do that.

Just unpack the distro, and edit lib/CGI/Uploader/.ht.cgi.uploader.conf to suit.

Check your edits:

shell>perl -Ilib scripts/report.config.pl

Keep in mind that if your 'use lib' line points to this unpacked distro,
all code will use lib/CGI/Uploader/.ht.cgi.uploader.conf, and not the one
installed in the Perl module directory.

However! After 'make install', code without a 'use lib' will in fact use
the installed version of this file. On my machine, under Debian, that's
/usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0/CGI/Uploader/.ht.cgi.uploader.conf.

If these files are different, you will become very confused.

2)
Install the module.

3)
Edit cgi-bin/*.pl to fix the 'use lib' lines.

Copy the example files into your (Apache's) cgi-bin/ dir, and set their execute bits.

shell>cp cgi-bin/*.pl ~/httpd/prefork/cgi-bin
shell>chmod a+x ~/httpd/prefork/cgi-bin/use.cgi.*.pl

4)
Copy the HTML templates into your doc root:

shell>cp -r htdocs/uploads ~/httpd/prefork/htdocs

5)
If desired, copy the code from conf/httpd.conf into your httpd.conf.

Restart Apache:

shell>~/httpd/prefork/bin/apachectl graceful

6)
Create the database table into which the meta-data for uploaded files will be put:

shell>perl -Ilib scripts/create.table.pl

This uses lib/CGI/Uploader/.ht.cgi.uploader.conf.

7)
Point your web client (Firefox) at /cgi-bin/use.cgi.simple.pl

Note: neither CGI::Simple nor CGI::Uploader::Test's method use_cgi_simple()
outputs to the database.

8)
Point your web client (Firefox) at /cgi-bin/use.cgi.uploader.pl

This does output to the database, so check that now:

psql>select * from uploads;
