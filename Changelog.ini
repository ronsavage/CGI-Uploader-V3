[BUG FIXES]
- There were was confusion in the 2.1 release as to whether the new API
for gen_thumb() took a hash or hashref as input. The code tests and docs
have all been updated to agree: It's a hashref. Thanks to bignose who
wrestled this one.

[ENHANCEMENTS]
- Further simplified necessary spec API while maintaining backwards
compatibility. Specifying a transformation method for a generated file
can now by this simple:
gen_files => {
photo_thumbnail => gen_thumb({ w => 100 h => 100})
}

[V 2.0]
Date=2005-12-17T23:12:35
Comments= <<EOT
[ENHANCEMENTS]
- Previously the extension and MIME type were inherited
by generated files. Now the metadata for generated files
is extracted directly from them. This should be useful
if you want to create thumbnails in a different image format
than the large images.
- A cleaner and simpler API for calling gen_thumb() and other potential
transform_methods has been introduced. The new syntax looks like this:
transform_method => gen_thumb({ w => 100 h => 100 })
The old syntax is still supported.
- "gen_thumb()" can now return the Image/Graphics::Magick object as a
second argument. This may not be useful outside of the test suite...
[BUG FIXES]
- Image::Magick is no longer required to install CGI::Uploader just
recommended.
- If an uploaded was updated and had its MIME type changed in the process
the old file was left on the file system. Fixed.
- If 'up_table_map' was used to modify the name of the extension field
then transform_meta() would return empty values for the extensions. Fixed.
[INTERNALS]
- Migrated Makefile.PL to use Module::Install. This allows me to keep the hairy
Makefile.PL stuff I have but easily add 'no_index' and 'recommends' metadata.
- test suite clean up.
- new required modules: Scalar::Util and HTTP::Request::Common

[THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
- 'file_name' is now required in the data model. You can simply add it before upgrading.
Something like this should work:
ALTER TABLE your_table_name ADD COLUMN file_name VARCHAR(255);
Of course you can name the column something else with the up_table_map.
[ENHANCEMENTS]
- extract_meta() now also returns the original filename with the
'file_name' key.
- PostgreSQL via ODBC is now supported (William McKee)

[RELEASE NOTES]
I changed the API again. The code has been refactored to remove all
image-specific code from the main package. In it's place a more general
"transform_method" option has been added. With this you can specify
any arbitrary transformation you want to make to a file. You might
choose to decrypt a file compress it append to it or otherwise alter
it.
The thumbnailing code still exists but has been moved to
CGI::Uploader::Transform::ImageMagick::gen_thumb().
However most of the examples and tests still do rely on "gen_thumb()" for
examples so test failures will occur if Image::Magick is not installed for
now. I'd like some help to streamline this.
Along the way I removed the regular expression support to simplify the
refactoring. It may well come back.
Beyond these changes things are pretty much the same. Let me know
if you have any feedback on the API before this turns into a stable
1.0 release.

Date=2004-04-21T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Removed custom_meta(). This problem space is now addressed by
allowing meta data to be passed to store_uploads(). Also you could
override extract_meta() to add more functionality there.
- Added support for storing files based on a MD5 sum of the files
ID. This allows the file storage to scale well for millions of uploads.
See the docs for 'file_scheme' for detaills. (Thanks to Randal Schwartz
for the suggestion).
- Added option to specify only a max width or max height for thumbnails.
- Refactored several interfaces to use named parameters.
- Added 'downsize' option to spec allowing downsizing of primary images.
0.70_01
- Added to binmode() calls to file handles to possibly help Windows.
- Added support for uploading via CGI::Simple
- Added experimental support for uploading via Apache::Request
- Added Cookbook documentation
- Added 'thumbnail_of_id' column to meta data table.
- Added delete_thumbs() method
- Started to do real 'updates' rather than delete/re-inserts
- Cleaned up prequisites in Makefile.PL
- Fixed bug and added test for proper thumbnail resizing
- More API refactors
0.63_01
- Removed some un-needed mentions of Data::FormValidator from tests
- added test to verify thumbnail size
- refactored resize code into gen_thumb(). This will make it easier
to support other resize modules besides Image::Magick.
- Added Image::Size as a dependency. It's a fast tool for size checking
which does not depend on a graphics module being installed.
- Initial support for resizing with GD as a backup. It needs tested.
0.62_01
- Added File::Temp to Makefile.PL.
- Refactored to remove store_thumb(). This should help eventually support other
graphics modules besides Image::Magick
0.61_02
- Minor POD cleanups
0.61_01
- Added custom_meta() method for more flexible meta data handled
- clarified code and extended documentation
- exposed 'build_loc' function which may be useful as a utility function
or for a sub-class.
- custom fields are now returned with meta_hashref()
0.60_02
- Added up_table_map test and fixed some related code.
0.60_01
- Added 'up_table_map' configuration option allowing for custom column
names.
- Documentation for several functions added.
- Began refactoring to make support for Apache::Request easier.

[THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
- create_img_tmpl_vars() has been replaced
with a more generic create_tmpl_vars().
It should still work the same for images
and better for non-images
- install_uploads() Now returns a hash ref
based on the valid hash with appropriate additions
and deletions already made.
- The interface for delete_upload() has changed to accomodate
deleting based on directly providing a upload ID.
